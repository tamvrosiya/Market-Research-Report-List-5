<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Displacement Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial displacement sensor market is divided into two main types: contact and non-contact sensors. Contact type sensors, such as linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) and potentiometers, measure displacement through direct physical contact with the target surface, offering high accuracy and resolution. In contrast, non-contact type sensors, including laser and ultrasonic sensors, utilize electromagnetic signals to measure displacement without physical contact, providing greater flexibility and reducing wear and tear. Both types cater to diverse industrial applications, ensuring precise measurement and monitoring.</p></p>

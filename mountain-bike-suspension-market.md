<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mountain Bike Suspension Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front Suspension</li><li>Rear Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mountain bike suspension market is divided into two main types: front suspension and rear suspension. Front suspension, commonly known as forks, absorbs shocks from the front wheel, enhancing control and comfort over rough terrain. Rear suspension involves a system integrated into the bike's frame, offering additional support and improved traction on uneven surfaces. Both types are essential for optimizing performance, with many riders choosing full-suspension bikes that combine both front and rear systems for a smoother, more controlled ride.</p></p>

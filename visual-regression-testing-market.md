<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Visual Regression Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Testing</li><li>Automation Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Visual Regression Testing Market includes two main types - Manual Testing and Automation Testing. </p><p>Manual Testing involves a tester visually comparing the current version of a website or application with a previous version to identify any visual discrepancies. While this method is time-consuming and prone to human error, it allows for a more thorough analysis of the visual aspects of the software.</p><p>Automation Testing, on the other hand, involves using tools and scripts to automatically detect visual changes between versions. This method is faster, more reliable, and scalable, making it ideal for large-scale projects with frequent updates.</p></p>

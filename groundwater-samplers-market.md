<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Groundwater Samplers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balanced</li><li>Adsorption</li><li>Grab</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Groundwater samplers are devices used to collect water samples from underground sources. There are three main types of groundwater samplers: balanced, adsorption, and grab. Balanced samplers use a pump to maintain a constant flow rate during sampling. Adsorption samplers rely on chemical reactions to capture specific contaminants. Grab samplers collect instant samples without the need for a pump. Each type of sampler has its own advantages and is chosen based on the specific characteristics of the groundwater being sampled.</p></p>

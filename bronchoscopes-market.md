<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bronchoscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Bronchoscopes</li><li>Flexible Bronchoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bronchoscopes are medical devices used to examine the inside of the airways in the lungs. There are two main types of bronchoscopes - rigid bronchoscopes and flexible bronchoscopes. Rigid bronchoscopes have a straight metal tube and are typically used for therapeutic procedures that require a larger working channel. Flexible bronchoscopes have a flexible fiber-optic cable and are more commonly used for diagnostic purposes due to their ability to navigate through the smaller airways. Both types play a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory conditions.</p></p>

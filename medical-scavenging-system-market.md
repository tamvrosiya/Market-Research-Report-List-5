<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Scavenging System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Vacuum Systems</li><li>Passive Vacuum Systems</li><li>Centralized</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical scavenging systems are used to remove waste anesthetic gases from operating rooms and other medical facilities to protect patients and medical staff from potential exposure. There are three main types of medical scavenging systems: active vacuum systems, which use a vacuum pump to actively remove and treat waste gases; passive vacuum systems, which rely on the pressure difference between the operating room and the outside environment to capture and remove waste gases; and centralized systems, which collect waste gases from multiple rooms and treat them in a central location. Each type offers unique advantages and is tailored to different facility needs.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embolic Protection Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distal Filter Devices</li><li>Distal Occlusion Devices</li><li>Proximal Occlusion Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Embolic Protection Devices are used during minimally invasive procedures to prevent debris from dislodging and causing blockages in blood vessels. There are three main types of embolic protection devices: Distal Filter Devices, which capture debris in a filter as it flows downstream, Distal Occlusion Devices, which temporarily block blood flow to prevent debris from traveling further, and Proximal Occlusion Devices, which block blood flow at the source of debris release. These devices improve the safety and effectiveness of procedures such as stent placement and angioplasty.</p></p>

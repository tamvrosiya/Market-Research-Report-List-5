<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Kidney Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical kidney dialysis machines market comprises two primary types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis uses a machine to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood through an artificial kidney, or dialyzer, requiring vascular access. Peritoneal dialysis, on the other hand, utilizes the patient's abdominal lining as a natural filter, infusing a dialysis solution into the abdominal cavity to remove waste. Both methods are essential for patients with kidney failure, offering different treatment options based on individual needs.</p></p>

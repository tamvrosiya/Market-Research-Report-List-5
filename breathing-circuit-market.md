<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breathing Circuit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open</li><li>Semi-Open</li><li>Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Open Breathing Circuits involve the flow of fresh gas into the patient's airways while exhaled gas is released into the environment. Semi-Open Circuits combine fresh gas with exhaled gas through a reservoir bag, minimizing waste. Closed Circuits recirculate exhaled gas, removing carbon dioxide and replenishing oxygen, making them more efficient for long-term anesthesia. Each type offers unique advantages and is utilized based on the specific needs of the patient and medical procedure.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Infrared Temperature Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>No-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital infrared temperature sensors are divided into two main types: contact and no-contact. Contact sensors require physical contact with the object being measured, providing accurate readings but potentially impacting the object's temperature. On the other hand, no-contact sensors measure temperature from a distance, making them ideal for monitoring moving objects or in sterile environments. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and food processing.</p></p>

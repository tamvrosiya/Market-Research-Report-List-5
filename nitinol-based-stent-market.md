<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitinol based Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Nitinol-based stent market features two primary types: Bare-metal Stents (BMS) and Drug-eluting Stents (DES). BMS are made from Nitinol, offering flexibility and adaptable deployment but lack coating or drugs, making them suitable for patients with low restenosis risks. DES, on the other hand, are coated with medication that slowly elutes to prevent tissue growth and reduce restenosis. Both types serve distinct patient needs, with DES typically preferred for higher-risk cases due to their enhanced performance in reducing reblockage.</p></p>
